1. You click on one and have to remember that you clicked on it
2. The cards shuffle
3. You have to click on another Pokemon
4. Repeat until you click on a clicked Pokemon or win.

## Project Description

This was my first project using Functional Components instead of Class Components and I had to test what I learned so far. 

## Challenges

1. Understanding useEffect was the most challenging thing in this project for me. I found the relationship between the dependency array and ComponentDidMount and ComponentDidUpdate. 
2. This was my second project using an API so manipulating information was relatively new for me at this point. 
3. The Pokeball that you see separating the main part with the header was done in CSS. After this I have more respect than ever for people that makes pieces of art for fun with CSS. Also I'm never forgeting position: absolute and position: relative again

## What I learned
  *  CSS
    -  I gained a basic understanding of how people make art with CSS
  *  React
    -  useState and useEffect hooks
    -  How to work with APIs with React
    -  How to use the react-modal library to easily create modals
